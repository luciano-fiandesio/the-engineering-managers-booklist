Hello, thanks for reading! A little about me, I have been an engineering manager at Fortune 100 companies and startups. This list represents the books that I have found valuable in my career. If you want to see what I'm reading checkout my list on [GoodRead's list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/39697003-jesse-palmer?shelf=currently-reading). Use the above buttons if you want to hear about my ramblings on engineering leadership.  

## Getting Started

### First book

If you are going to read one book off of this list, I highly recommend the following:

### Best of the List

There are a ton of great books on this list, but if you want to start out reading the top books, I would recommend the following:

### Tips on Book Selection

The books or subjects aren't in any particular order so feel free to dive into the topics that you want to learn more about. If you are comfortable with your tech skills, I would recommend diving into the soft skills section. If you are more confident in your
soft skills, then I would recommend picking out some books in the tech skills section.
